Advice Generator In React
This web app will give you a random piece of advice on page load and subsequent advice when you click on the dice. Fully responsive and uses an API.

Peer Review by Marcel Rodriguez - The design is spot on with the design files given with the addition of a bar to let you know when the button is ready for refresh. Works well, only critique is that the yellow bar isnâ€™t responsive. Awesome work!
